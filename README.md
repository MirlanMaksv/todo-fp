This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Simple TODO react app

The main goal is to apply functional programming

## User stories

- As a user, I want to create a todo task to access it later
- As a user, I want todo list to clearly see all my todos
- As a user, I want to label todos so that I can filter them
- As a user, I want filtering by dates, labels, and title so that I can easily find todos
- As a user, I want sorting by dates, labels so that I can see them in some order
- As a user, I want todo permanent removal so that I can clean unnecessary todos
- As a user, I want to be able to set deadline of a todo to control completion
- As a user, I want to see warnings when deadline of a todo is close so I will not miss it
